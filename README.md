# Horiseon Social Solution Services

This project required the refactor of a website in order to create a structure that would allow the website to be more accessible. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## What I Changed

Now the code reflects changes that meet these accessibility standards. Several of the elements I changed within the text include the title, adding semantic elements (header, navs, article, sections, aside, and footer), and updated the css file to reflect the changes from the index.html.

## Review

This project was completed one minor step at a time. Each time an element was changed, I refreshed the webpage to make sure it did not change the layout of the website. At first I thought I needed to change a lot more than I did, but afer further research, it turned out to be way less complicated than I initially thought. Overall, this homework assignment helped me learn the structure and layout of proper website elements.
